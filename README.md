#A Tribute To Daniel Bulow (w1n5t0n)

Douglas: Everything in the visible universe is composed of atoms formed in stars. From all reaches of the cosmos, they come together in brief and beautiful moments, forever entwined with space and time. Doni serves to remind us of our noble origins. A beautiful beacon in an infinite lineage of stars.
As many of you know, Doni wasn't a religious person. In honor of Doni's memory, I would like to offer you the best consolations that physics can afford. The First Law of Thermodynamics tells us that energy is neither created nor destroyed. It is infinite in its extent and motion, transferred between all beings, all mass, all matter composing the universe. Doni's energy is not gone. He is always with us, and always has been with us. Every quanta of energy, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by his smile, by the touch of his hands, hundreds of trillions of particles now translated into memory that will forever redefine us, all of us honored to have known him.

xMonsterx (Brandon): Doni was my best friend. Not my best friend online, not my best friend at the moment, my best friend. Period. I loved him as a friend, and as much as a brother. He was a gift to the world, a brilliant mind, gone too soon. He was a mentor to some, a friend to many, and an amazing person to all. My only regret is that he is gone so soon, and if I could do anything to change that, I would. Rest in peace, my friend.
